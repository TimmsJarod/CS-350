Emerging Sys Arch &amp; Tech

##Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project tested my understanding of operating concurrent timers and drivers required to access perifreals on the Texas Instruments SimpleLink Launchpad. The project required me to initialize these drivers in order to pull data, analyze it, and output information through a terminal and LED indecators based on the results of the data on a timer. This was a prototype for a thermostat project, which also required us to explore other chip architectures from Texas Instruments, Microchip, and Freescape Semiconductor, to identify which would be the best microcontroller for enabling the project with WiFi compoatability.

##What did you do particularly well?

I sucessfully implemented the code required to initialize and operate the various drivers required for the project. This included  GPIO pin operation, I2C, UART, and timers to succesfully read and write data on separately timed intervals. I was able to effectively complete code that preformed actions separately on clocks of 200, 500, and 1000 milliseconds. I also provided research into potential microcontrollers from three separate vendors to find canidates from each one and give an reasonable reccommendation on which microcontroller would best suit the project's needs.

##Where could you improve?

For one assignment, I struggled to locate the necessary functions I required to complete the assignment. It was only later that I discovered that I had led myself down the wrong path and was looking for the wrong solution to my problem and found the method I should have been using much later. I should have reseached the issue I was dealing with in a broader scope to notice that the path I was on would not lead me to a finished produt. Reading documentation for possible functions could have put me on a better path.

##What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?



##What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

This course covered common elements in embedded systems such as how to operate GPIO pins and how to use UART and I2C serial communication, all of which are common in many embedded systems and projects relating to programming for hardware devices.

##How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I fully commented my work to ensure that all code was easily read and followed best practices. I also ensured that all code segments were organized in a pattern that made logical sense.
